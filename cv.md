 Taking the first steps in IT. Now I 'm learning the course from RS School - «JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0».

 My first solved problem on Codewars:
> This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.
``` 
function multiply(a, b){
  a * b
}
```
 Decision:
``` 
multiply = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```
